1. 1st Data Source
  - Columns: URL, ID, Name, Subtitle, Icon URL, Average User Rating, Price, In-app Purchases, Description,  Developer, Age Rating, Languages, Size, Primary Genre, Genres, Original Release Date, Current Version Release Date
  - Observations on initial state of data
  	- Subtitle and In-app Purchases columns have many NaN values, Languages has list of two-letter country codes, and Date columns are in D/M/Y format
2. 2nd Data Source
  - Columns: Unnamed, ID, Name, Size, Currency, Price, Total Rating Count, Rating Count Latest Version, Total Average User Rating, Average User Rating Latest Version, Latest Version, Content Rating, Primary Genre

## Transform
1. 1st Data Source
  - Columns dropped: 
  	- Subtitle and In-app Purchases, because of the NaN values 
	- Icon URL, because it is irrelevant to analysis
	- Genres, because these are subgenres of games, and the other datasets are of mixed primary genre without subgenres
  - Drop Na rows
  - Converted dates to M/D/Y format
  - Aggregated Language country codes to a count of languages
