## Extract
1. 1st Data Source
  - Columns: URL, ID, Name, Subtitle, Icon URL, Average User Rating, Price, In-app Purchases, Description,  Developer, Age Rating, Languages, Size, Primary Genre, Genres, Original Release Date, Current Version Release Date
  - Observations on initial state of data
  	- Subtitle and In-app Purchases columns have many NaN values, Languages has list of two-letter country codes, and Date columns are in D/M/Y format
2. 2nd Data Source
  - Columns: Unnamed, ID, Name, Size, Currency, Price, Total Rating Count, Rating Count Latest Version, Total Average User Rating, Average User Rating Latest Version, Latest Version, Content Rating, Primary Genre, Number of Supporting Devices, Number of Screenshots, Number of Supported Languages, VPP Licensing, App Description
  - Observations on initial state of data
  	- Unnamed column doesn't make sense
	- App Description was in a second csv table, with duplications of ID, Name, and Size columns
3. 3rd Data Source
  - Two tables: Primary App Data table, and App Reviews table

## Transform
1. 1st Data Source
  - Columns dropped: 
  	- Subtitle and In-app Purchases, because of the NaN values 
	- Icon URL, because it is irrelevant to analysis
	- Genres, because these are subgenres of games, and the other datasets are of mixed primary genre without subgenres
  - Dropped rows with NaN values
  - Converted dates to M/D/Y format
  - Aggregated Language country codes to a count of languages
2. 2nd Data Source
  - Columns dropped:
  	- Unnamed because it makes no sense
	- Supporting Devices, Screenshots, VPP Licensing because irrelevant
  - No rows had NaN values

## Load
Description of the final databaseâ€™s tables/collections:
Database name: project_two_db
Tables:
1. appstore_strat_games (Data Source 1)
  - The primary key of the appstore_strat_games was the Name column that identified the names of the app. This was also a string. We listed the price ID and Primary_Genre as the foreign keys here with the apple_store_apps table.
2. apple_store_apps (Data Source 2)
  - We identified the primary key of the apple_store_apps table as the track name and the foreign keys would be price and prime_genre. Most of the columns in this table were strings and 1 integer that we identified.
3. google_play_apps (Data Source 3)
4. google_play_apps_rev (Data Source 3)
  - The  google_play_apps and google_play_apps_rev had less foreign keys here. We also did not have as many columns in comparison to the App store data we captured. The foreign key on these tables were the App column. All off the columns on the google_play_apps_rev table were Strings. The google_play_apps only has Reviews, size, installs, and price as an integer and the rest of the of the columns were strings.

Our client asked for us to extract all avilable Kaggle data on apps from both Google and Apple app stores, and to clean this data so that as many apps as had complete data in both stores could be compared with one another.
